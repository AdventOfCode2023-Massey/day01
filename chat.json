          "value": "If the words can overlap, we need to modify our approach again. We can use a regular expression to find all possible matches of spelled out digits and numeric digits in the text. However, Python's built-in `re.findall` function doesn't return overlapping matches. To find overlapping matches, we can use a lookahead assertion in our regular expression. Here's how you can do it:\n\n```python\nimport re\nimport sys\n\ndef sum_calibration_values_from_file(file_path):\n    digit_map = {\n        'one': '1', 'two': '2', 'three': '3', 'four': '4',\n        'five': '5', 'six': '6', 'seven': '7', 'eight': '8', 'nine': '9'\n    }\n    total = 0\n    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:\n        for line in file:\n            first_digit = last_digit = None\n            for word in re.findall(r'(?=(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|\\d))', line):\n                if word.isdigit():\n                    if first_digit is None:\n                        first_digit = word\n                    last_digit = word\n                elif word in digit_map:\n                    if first_digit is None:\n                        first_digit = digit_map[word]\n                    last_digit = digit_map[word]\n            if first_digit and last_digit:\n                total += int(first_digit + last_digit)\n    return total\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    filename = sys.argv[1]\n    print(sum_calibration_values_from_file(filename))\n```\n\nYou can run this script from the command-line like this:\n\n```bash\npython script.py calibration_document.txt\n```\n\nThis script uses the `re.findall` function with a lookahead assertion `(?=...)` to find all overlapping occurrences of spelled out digits and numeric digits in each line. The lookahead assertion `(?=...)` is a zero-width assertion that matches the position before the start of a match, allowing for overlapping matches.",
